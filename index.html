<h4 class="introduction"> OUR MISSION</h4>
<div class="missionStatement">
    <p> RateMyProfessors: Wellesley Edition provides information all in one place about any professor or course at Wellesley that you are considering.</p>
    <p>Rather than asking individual students how their experiences were with a professor, users can easily search a professor.
        We gather information on various important factors to provide comprehensive reviews of a professor and their classes. Not only will users see teaching and 
        difficulty ratings, but our page goes beyond that so users will also be informed on other specificities including tutors, textbooks, studying tips, and more. On the home page,
        users can see featured top rated classes that they won't want to miss out on!
    </p> 
    <p>If you are a student at Wellesley, please contribute to RateMyProfessors: Wellesley Edition by reviewing any professors whose courses you have taken.</p>
